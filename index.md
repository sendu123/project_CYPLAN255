### 1.Background
#### 1.1 Pollution And Health Risks

Silicon Valley, with a bright economic future, is now facing a serious ecological pollution crisis, including dust pollution, chemical pollution, water pollution and health problems. So we are thinking about finding an ecological method to dream a new future for silicon valley, to protect the native species.

#### 1.2 Umbrellar Species
At the same time, we find that **Bay Checkerspot Butterfly** is a key umbrella species that protects many native animals and plants in Silicon Valley. So it seems like butterflies can help build a new ecological future in Silicon Valley.

However, in the study of bay checkerspot butterfly, it was found that they are rapidly declining. Itâ€™s imperative and imminent that we should pay more attention to such important species. Therefore, the goal of this project was to create a tool for generating the suitability map and find out where the best places to build butterfly habitats are in San Jose.

### 3.Life cycle of butterfly

The key findings focus on habitats that are suitable for three stages of the butterfly's life cycle, including Caterpillar stage, butterfly stage and full lifecycle threats. The reason for having these three periods is that caterpillars and butterflies have different ranges of activities.
