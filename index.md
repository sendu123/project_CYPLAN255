## Dream of An Ecological Silicon Valley
### Bay Checkerspot Butterfly Help Build A New Ecological Future in Silicon Valley

Silicon Valley, with a bright economic future, is now facing a serious ecological pollution crisis, including dust pollution, chemical pollution, water pollution and health problems. So we are thinking about finding an ecological method to dream a new future for silicon valley, to protect the native species.

At the same time, we find that **Bay Checkerspot Butterfly** is a key umbrella species that protects many native animals and plants in Silicon Valley. So it seems like butterflies can help build a new ecological future in Silicon Valley.

However, in the study of bay checkerspot butterfly, it was found that they are rapidly declining. Itâ€™s imperative and imminent that we should pay more attention to such important species. 
Therefore, the goal of this project was to create a tool for generating the suitability map and find out where the best places to build butterfly habitats are in San Jose.
