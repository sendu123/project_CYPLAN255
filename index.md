### 1.Background
#### 1.1 Pollution And Health Risks
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sendu123/project_CYPLAN255/gh-pages/drawings/background.png)

Silicon Valley, with a bright economic future, is now facing a serious ecological pollution crisis, including dust pollution, chemical pollution, water pollution and health problems. So we are thinking about finding an ecological method to dream a new future for silicon valley, to protect the native species.

#### 1.2 Umbrellar Species
At the same time, we find that **Bay Checkerspot Butterfly** is a key umbrella species that protects many native animals and plants in Silicon Valley. So it seems like butterflies can help build a new ecological future in Silicon Valley.

However, in the study of bay checkerspot butterfly, it was found that they are rapidly declining. Itâ€™s imperative and imminent that we should pay more attention to such important species. Therefore, the goal of this project was to create a tool for generating the suitability map and find out where the best places to build butterfly habitats are in San Jose.

### 3.Life cycle of butterfly

The key findings focus on habitats that are suitable for two stages of the butterfly's life cycle, including **Caterpillar stage, butterfly stage**. The reason for having these three periods is that caterpillars and butterflies have different ranges of activities.

### 4.Key Findings
In this part, we use python to generate to distributions of certain needs and overlay the distribution and topography to help people better understand the context. Also, rate diffrent kinds of needs, the best one for caterpillars or butterflies to live wins the highest point. This rating systerm can halp create the final suitability map in the next step.

#### 4.1 Needs of Caterpillar
#### 4.1.1 Living on low shrubs
First, in the Caterpillar Stage, our key finding is that caterpillars need to hang on small bushes to absorb heat from the ground. So we use geopandas to visualize the distribution of four kinds of low shrubs. There are four different colors in this map representing these shrubs.

#### 4.1.2 Living near ridgelines
Caterpillars should be near ridge lines because butterflies need to spawn and mate at ridgelines. So we visualize the distribution of ridge lines through geopandas.

#### 4.1.3 Living in serpentine soil

Caterpillars need to diapause in serpentine soil, which allows butterfly larvae or chrysalises to live in it and prevents animals from trampling on it. The source of the soil data is from a historic distribution map, I used georeference tools to get the coordinates, and finally generate the area in geopandas.

#### 4.1.4 Living near host plants
Caterpillars also need host plants for food, then I found three main host plants for caterpilars. And use geopandas to show the locations of the host plants.caterpillars.

But we found that the point is too small to generate a suitability map when overlay those layers, so we change those point data to **Kernel Density** of host plants.

#### 4.1.5 Living away from roads
Nitrogen dioxide produced by roads would encourage the growth of invasive species, these invasive species are main threats for host plants which are native to California. Therefore, the area within 200 meters of the road is very bad for caterpillars. I set up a 200-meter buffer for the road in Python, and the area inside the buffer gets only one point, while the area outside the buffer gets nine points.

#### 4.1.6 Living away from developed land
I also take land use into account because human development has an impact on species. This is a map showing distribution of developed lands with different land use. Depending on how much damage they do to the butterflies, they get different points.

#### 4.2 Needs of Butterfly
#### 4.2.1 Living near host plants
In the Butterfly Stage, butterflies also need nectar plants for food. Here is the diatribution of the nectar plants of bay checkerspot butterfly.

I use the same method to get the Kernel Density of Nectar Plants.

#### 4.2.2 Living near ridgelines
Butterflies need ridgelines to mate, and I also get the distribution of Ridgelines as well as a 200 meter buffer because butterflies and caterpillars have different flying abilities.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sendu123/project_CYPLAN255/gh-pages/drawings/b_ridge6.png)

#### 4.2.3 Living near water
I also get the distribution of wetlands in San Jose because butterflies need waterlands for drinking water.

### 5.Results---Suitability Map
Eventually, we used raster calculator to combine all layers to two suitability maps respectively for Caterpillar and Butterfly. Because in the previous stage, we graded each layer. Now each pixel in different images has different scores. I reclassify the scores in each image and add the scores of each pixel in different images to form two suitable maps for butterflies and caterpillars.

![](https://github.com/sendu123/project_CYPLAN255/blob/gh-pages/drawings/map_final.png)

In the future, these area with the highest scores will have the biggise chance to build a habitat for bay checkerspot butterfly. Once the butterfly species are established, the native plants and animals under the "umbrella" will be protected, and the chance of an ecological future of Silicon Valley will be established.
